# Example 1
# To compare different gears ,bycyclists use the ratio of the number of teeths.

chaining = 52                     # number of teeth
cog      = 11
ratio    = chaining/cog.to_f
puts ratio                       # -> 4.72727272727275

chaining = 30
cog      = 27
ratio    = chaining / cog.to_f  #1.1111111111111112
puts ratio
